## üöÄ The Development Journey

This project was built using an iterative process, starting from a basic concept and adding layers of functionality and design improvements.

### Step 1: Foundational Structure & Core Content

I started by creating a single HTML file to serve as the foundation. The primary goal was to lay out the core content, including the "About Me," "Projects," and "Contact" sections. I integrated my portfolio summary and key skills, using semantic HTML and Tailwind CSS for initial styling to ensure a clean, modern look.

### Step 2: Content Enrichment & Navigation

Next, I focused on making the content more accessible and useful. I integrated live links to individual project documents and folders, allowing visitors to dive deeper into my work. I also added a prominent "View Resume" button on the hero section for easy access. The navigation menu was configured with smooth-scroll functionality, enhancing the user experience.

### Step 3: Adding Visual Flair & Polish

To bring the website to life, I implemented subtle CSS animations. This included fade-in and slide-up effects for sections and project cards as they come into view. I also refined the layout of the project buttons, ensuring they were consistently aligned, and added Font Awesome icons to the contact section to give it a professional, branded feel.

### Step 4: Building a Functional Contact Form

The biggest challenge was to make the contact form work without a backend server. I solved this by integrating a third-party service called **Formspree**. I configured the form's `action` attribute to my unique Formspree endpoint, and used JavaScript's Fetch API to handle the submission process asynchronously. This ensures a smooth, non-refreshing user experience while the form data is securely delivered to my email.

### Step 5: Final Review & Deployment

After all features were implemented, I conducted a final review to correct any small formatting errors and ensure the code was clean and well-commented. The single-file approach made the website easy to manage and deploy to a hosting service like GitHub Pages.
