## üöÄ The Development Journey

This portfolio was built with no prior coding experience, using an AI assistant as the primary development tool. My role was to act as the project manager, providing clear instructions and refining the output at each stage. This demonstrates my ability to communicate technical requirements, manage project scope, and leverage new technologies to solve problems.

### Step 1: Foundational Structure & Core Content

I instructed the AI to create the basic HTML structure for a personal portfolio, including sections for "About Me," "Projects," and "Contact." I then provided a summary of my portfolio and personal details, and the AI integrated this information into the initial layout.

### Step 2: Content Enrichment & Navigation

Using the AI, I provided links to my project files and my resume. The AI then generated the necessary HTML to turn these into clickable buttons and added smooth-scrolling functionality to the navigation menu, improving user experience.

### Step 3: Adding Visual Flair & Polish

I asked the AI to add dynamic visual elements. The AI implemented CSS animations that cause sections and project cards to fade in and slide up as the user scrolls. It also refined the button layouts and added professional icons to the contact section.

### Step 4: Building a Functional Contact Form

To make the contact form fully functional, I researched and decided to use a third-party service, Formspree. I provided the AI with my Formspree endpoint and instructed it to build a contact form that could send messages without requiring a page refresh.

### Step 5: Final Review & Deployment

As a final step, I instructed the AI to review the entire codebase for any errors or inconsistencies. The single-file approach made the website easy to manage and deploy to a hosting service like GitHub Pages.
